# Crowdfunding_ETL
In our recent project, we teamed up to tackle an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) challenge using Python and Pandas. The main goal was to process data from Excel files (`crowdfunding.xlsx` and `contacts.xlsx`), transform it into structured CSV files, design a database schema, and then populate a PostgreSQL database named `crowdfunding_db`.
